## Overview

#### CultureCrafts is an online e-commerce website where you can showcase your own and/or shop for others customized and personalized crafty creations right from the comfort of wherever you are.

## MVP

Create an application where users can showcase their custom crafts to the community and buy/sell with other members of the community. MVP will be having a functional site that allows users to manage their own products offering and also be able to view other users products from the main page. Users can add other users products as favorites that will be housed in a separate component.

### Goals

- _Incorporate user authentication in order for user to be able to add any items to shopping cart._
- _Style the website using CSS and make it responsive to different screen sizes._
- _Build a foundation for users being able to view products and inquire about custom orders via email._
- _This project will have a Ruby on Rails back end server with RESTful JSON endpoints._
- _Project will have both 1:m and m:m associations between user/products/cart/order with full CRUD functionality on backend with users/product reviews and create and delete with favorites._
- _Front End will be built with React. Site will have a landing page that displays a list of all products with image and price._
- _Each product on the page will be a clickable link that takes you to a details page for that product._
- _Users will also have full CRUD access regarding creating and updating their profile as well._
