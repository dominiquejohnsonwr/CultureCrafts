- _Style the website using CSS and make it responsive to different screen sizes._
- _Build a foundation for users being able to create orders then submit them via email for processing._

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|   React Router   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
| React SemanticUI | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|     Express      | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|  Express Router  | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like.

```structure

src
|__ assets/
|__ fonts
|__ graphics
|__ images
|__ mockups
|__ components/
|__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
